//! Lightweight, env-gated per-region wall-clock timing for diagnosing prover
//! hot paths *in situ* — without writing a separate benchmark per sub-step.
//!
//! Sprinkle [`scope`] calls around the regions of interest in the real prover
//! code; each returns an RAII guard that, on drop, records its elapsed time into
//! a thread-local table keyed by a `&'static str` label. Scopes **nest**: a
//! guard alive while an inner guard opens and closes becomes that inner guard's
//! parent, so the table tracks both *inclusive* (wall-clock, self + descendants)
//! and *self* (exclusive of child scopes) time per region. Call
//! [`dump_and_reset`] once per measured unit (e.g. just after a criterion
//! `bench.iter`) to print the tree — in execution order, indented by depth, with
//! each region's share of the total instrumented time — to stderr, then clear.
//!
//! **Zero-cost when off.** Every [`scope`] checks a process-cached flag and,
//! when `OBLONG_PROFILE` is unset, returns an inert guard whose `Drop` does
//! nothing; [`dump_and_reset`] is then a no-op. Enable with `OBLONG_PROFILE=1`
//! in the environment. Because criterion lets stderr through while capturing
//! stdout, the table lands next to the benchmark output.
//!
//! **Threading.** Timing is thread-local: place scopes on the control-flow
//! thread (which blocks on any rayon join inside the region), *not* inside
//! parallel worker closures — a main-thread scope then measures the region's
//! true wall-clock including its parallel section, and nesting stays correct.
//!
//! Intended for the F_2 SHA-256 prover — the e2e prove path (`f2_prove.rs`) and
//! the oblong Hadamard discharge (`prove_oblong_and_*` in `zinc-poly`); see
//! `documentation/f2x-sha-todo.md`.
